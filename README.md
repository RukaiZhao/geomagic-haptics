Table of Contents

In the "OpenHaptic resources" folder, you can find guides that are related to OpenHaptics installation and programming.

In the "set up" folder, the "HapticProgramSetup" will tell you how to set up the environment for Haptic programming and "hapticProject_Properties" includes the directories and additional library.

The codes for my programs are in the "Single Haptic Application" and "Socket Haptic Application" folder.

I have also included my thesis paper which called "HapticProjectPaper" in the repository.
